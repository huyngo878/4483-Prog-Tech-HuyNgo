### The primary arithmetic problem

We'll be checking the units place of both numbers first,
then the tens place, then the hundreds place, and so on.
For each place, if there's a carry from the previous operation, we include that in our sum.
If the sum of digits in the current position exceeds 9, then a carry will be generated.
