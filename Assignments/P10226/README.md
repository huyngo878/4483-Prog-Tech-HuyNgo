### The hardwood species problem

I used a map to store and count each tree species
Then i iterate over the map then calculate the perecentages of each
species relative to the number of total trees.

This problem in my opinion was a great way to use maps, great for early on into the class where people might not have experience maps before I rate this on a 3/10 for hardness.
